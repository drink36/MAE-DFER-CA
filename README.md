## ‚ú® Overview

Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (DFER) is facing **supervised dillema**. On the one hand, current efforts in DFER focus on developing *various* deep supervised models, but only achieving *incremental* progress which is mainly attributed to the *longstanding lack* of large-scale high-quality datasets. On the other hand, due to the *ambiguity* and *subjectivity* in facial expression perception, acquiring large-scale high-quality DFER samples is pretty *time-consuming* and *labor-intensive*. Considering that there are massive unlabeled facial videos on the Internet, this work aims to **explore a new way** (i.e., self-supervised learning) which can fully exploit large-scale *unlabeled* data to largely advance the development of DFER.

Inspired by recent success of VideoMAE, MAE-DFER makes an early attempt to devise a novel masked autoencoder based self-supervised framework for DFER. It improves VideoMAE by developing an *efficient* LGI-Former as the encoder and introducing *joint* masked appearance and motion modeling. With these two core designs, MAE-DFER *largely* reduces the computational cost (about 38% FLOPs) during fine-tuning while having comparable or even *better* performance.

Extensive experiments on *six* DFER datasets show that our MAE-DFER *consistently* outperforms the previous best supervised methods by *significant* margins (**\+5‚àº8%** UAR on three *in-the-wild* datasets and **\+7‚àº12%** WAR on three *lab-controlled* datasets), which demonstrates that it can learn *powerful* dynamic facial representations for DFER via large-scale self-supervised pre-training. We believe MAE-DFER **has paved a new way** for the advancement of DFER and can inspire more relevant research in this field and even other related tasks (e.g., dynamic micro-expression recognition and facial action unit detection).

## ‚û°Ô∏è Data Preparation

Please follow the files (e.g., [ferv39k.py](preprocess/ferv39k.py)) in [preprocess](preprocess) for data preparation.

Specifically, you need to enerate annotations for dataloader ("<path_to_video> <video_class>" in annotations). 
The annotation usually includes `train.csv`, `val.csv` and `test.csv`. The format of `*.csv` file is like:

```
dataset_root/video_1  label_1
dataset_root/video_2  label_2
dataset_root/video_3  label_3
...
dataset_root/video_N  label_N
```

An example of [train.csv](saved/data/ferv39k/all_scenes/train.csv) is shown as follows:

```
/home/drink36/Desktop/Dataset/39K/Face/Action/Happy/0267 0
/home/drink36/Desktop/Dataset/39K/Face/Action/Happy/0316 0
/home/drink36/Desktop/Dataset/39K/Face/Action/Happy/0090 0
```
